# solo

Software for the Solo system - core tools for provisioning a bootable
SD card image.

This code is used in putting together a Solo Software Image
for the Solo Sytem.  

It takes a raspbian image and provisions it for the Solo, then
produces a solo.img which can be flashed to and SD card and booted
directly in the raspi.

Nobody except the author has ever used it. But now it is on github, so that might change.
