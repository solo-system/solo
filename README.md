# solo
Software for the Solo system - core tools for provisioning a bootable SD card image.

This pile of stuff is used in putting together a Solo Software Image for the Solo Sytem.
It takes a raspbian image and provisions it for the Solo, then produces a solo.img which can be flashed to and SD card and booted directly in the raspi.
