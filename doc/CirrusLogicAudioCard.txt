Integrating CLAC (cirrus logic audio card)
==========================================

Cirrus still don't have drivers sorted out.  They have an img
(massive) based on 3.12 kernel (raspbian uses 3.18 currently). 

I've tried using the img and it works, but it's massive, and I don't
like having to maintain support for 2 totally different kernels
(DeviceTree on in one and not in the other).  Sooo... Ragnar Jensen
has released both an Img file, AND a tar file which can be unpacked
over the stock raspbian and used.  It's this img that I'm going to
use.  (I'd prefer to use the tar file, but don't have time today.)

So policy is for provision to provision in a GENERAL way, supporting
whatever hardware we might ever need to support, and then solo-boot.sh
can enable whatever it wants, once it can see the hardware (at boot
time).  This doesn't apply to kernels, so I'm hoping the CLAC kernel
(from RJ) will operate fine if there is no CLAC hardware present (and
we don't (therefore) try to configure it).  If the raspi.org people
ever get a smart-boot thing going that can autodetect pi versus piv2
(diff processor) then perhaps that intelligence can also be used to
control what boots.  Actually, this must already exist (for the pi2 /
pi decision, but don't know how it works).
