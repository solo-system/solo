just got this whilst mounting a filled sdcard on linux:
[388016.533423] FAT-fs (sdd3): utf8 is not a recommended IO charset for FAT filesystems, filesystem will be case sensitive!
The mkfs.fat line in solo-boot/FIRSTBOOT should probably be changed.  



TODO: for the Solo Software (Image)
===================================

Release Checklist:
0) who is the release for.
1) led flashes DONE
2) uptime load is low
3) df / has space
4) no strange dmesg messages
5) arecord.log has no xruns.
6) check it runs on A+ B+ and Pi2

RC bugs:
provision.sh - leave me alone should be earlier.
what is solologdir.
what is DEBUG (it's in 3 files)
rename kernels (but where do we put modules?)
default to DMIC / linein. (and gains?) CHOOSE

All stuff below is dumped here from various email / notes Feb 2016:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

echo 0 > /sys/devices/platform/bcm2708_usb/buspower;

find /sys/devices/ -name `dmesg -t | grep dwc_otg | grep “DWC OTG Controller” | awk ‘{print $2}’ | cut -d”:” -f1`


f you downclock your core, i think you consume less power too.
Adding this lines to your config.txt
arm_freq_min=250
core_freq_min=100
sdram_freq_min=150
over_voltage_min=0 or 4 if you have overclocked your rasppi

Notes on witty pi usage and DC-DC converter efficiency based on 6
hours per day ON.

All amp measurements are @ 12V

should work in maH/day as an average consumption.  Then know a 50Ah
batery will last N days.


Assume RPI uses 40mA when running. (44 on screen, flash to 65 => ave 50, minus \
10 of converter).

nowitty + converterBasic = (40+10)mA * 24hrs = 1200 mAh / day
nowitty + converterExtra = (40+ 1)mA * 24hrs =  984 mAh / day

WITH WITTY:

witty + converterBasic = (40+10)mA * 6hrs + (10)mA * 18hrs = 480 mAh / day
witty + converterPlus  = (40+ 1)mA * 6hrs + (1)mA * 18hrs  = 264 mAh / day

All stuff below here is pre the Jan-2016 work:
----------------------------------------------
move asoundrc into amon repo

purge .git directories too.  And all RJ's code we inadvertently included.

purge /var/log since it's full of old dmesg and syslog stuff.

switchoff.py is a "service / daemon" and should be interrupt driven (I think).

Crontab: premature cronning:
ISSUE: where do we fill out the crontab with amon watchdog?
solo-boot:  No - this means user changes are lost at every reboot
first-boot:  OK (current implementation).  But lacks flexibility of enabling/disabling packages later.
provision: No - far too early - don't want crontabs running during install process.
best is a service based management of all this - using updstar/systemd etc... but leave for now since in flux.

Change /etc/fstab to have proper numbers in columns 5,6 for fsck

/etc/hosts contains a copy of system hostname - ensure we update/set it when we set hostname

Disarm raspi-config warning: "the software on this Raspberry Pi has not been fully configured"

Turn off swap with dphyswap or whatever it's called (and ensure 100Mb file is removed).

Support more microphones (USB) - set volume in a device independent
way.  What are the sample rates - does the new alsa-utils
--dump-hw-params show this sort of thing?

Support audio input dongles. (see recent german article on audio boards for rpi).

A general API for configuration?

Clacker: it was fragile but did work.  How to do more complex
playbacks in the field?  Hardware is the difficult bit.
  Design a
playback system with nice interface.

Refactor switchoff.sh script as GPIOhandler.py/sh and make it interrupt driven so we can have better responsiveness.

What should be done with GPU_split ? in /boot/config.txt

Compression
===========

Just tested lame.  on 1 minute.  lame -f is 5x realtime, and lame (default) is 3.38 realtime.  
lame	3.38RT	9.0%			
lame -f 4.96RT  9.0% (sizes are exactly the same since CBR of 64Kbps)
lame process size is less than 5MB of ram running.

TODO:
straighten out logic in amoncleanup, with its no-ops and stuff.  think
we need a are-we-running function which returns yes/no.  if yes, its
cos everything is running well, if NO its because were not running.
If there is an error, it should clear out the error and leave things
NOT running.  I think.  sort out fake-hw clock, which saves / restores
estimated times over reboots.  Is this worth trying ?  Surely...
clarify use of local.settings - warn about defaults, how about amon
config to show what it will do.

serial console cable
--------------------
lsusb:
ID 067b:2303 Prolific Technology, Inc. PL2303 Serial Port
wire: black to ground, white to Tx, green to Rx.  on outside row:
..GTR.........  (ground transmit receive) (black, white, green)
can also attach red to pins to the left (both 5V) to power the pi from USB.

boot the pi
then run this on the laptop (you need to be in group dialout)
screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200

and you should see the login prompt.  if you can not type, use minicom
to turn off flow control.  8-N-1 bit arrangement.

PPP: set up pppd to accept point-to-point internet link.
sudo apt-get install pppd 
hmmm - ppp not easy...

=============================================
Bespoke arecord.c :
sudo apt-get --compile source alsa-utils
installs and compiles source.  BUT you need to add lots of dependentpackages
================

Bluetooth networking:
=====================
I got bluetooth tethering working between my laptop and andriod phone
(pc gets internet through phone) via bluetooth by enableing tethering
on the phone, and then using the gui bluetooth thing in ubuntu to
conect to the android's network service.

bluetooth:
sudo apt-get install bluetooth bluez-utils bluez-compat 
hciconfig dev       # can we see local device
hciconfig up        # bring up local device
hciconfig status    # to check
hcitool scan        # scan for devices with
sudo bluez-simple-agent hci0 00:1F:E1:E5:C5:A5 # pair with him (pins ensue)
sudo bluez-test-device list  # list paired devices.


sdptool browse local # list services offered by "local" sevice

Then make the master (my pc) listen for 

sudo l2ping 00:1F:81:00:08:30 # run me on laptop

sudo l2ping  00:1F:E1:E5:C5:A5 # run me on pi

# connect from pi:
sudo pand -c 00:1F:E1:E5:C5:A5 --role PANU --persist 30

# setup PC to listen for connections
