OK - the fe-pi support is important, but so is stabilizing and testing
all the changes to the core.  Not enough testing recently.

So there are 5 systems set up, and I need to run them through.

PLAN:
1) Add clocks to the 5 systems.
2) Clac, Snowflake, SB2, SB3, dodotronic, [fe-pi]
3) build today's image.
4) flash 5 cards
5) turn them on and run them.
----

Cycle through the cards, checking each system.  looking for:
1) time set right.
2) no overruns in arecord.log
3) good sounding audio.

With each cycle, choose a different timezone, samplerate, channels, etc...

----------------------------------
Next Time:
the pi3 beside shub is where it was working.  I shut it down, to recharge battery.
boot it again, and continue fiddling with gains.
Also solve why it didn't run on the pizero - might be conflict with shim clock.

support fe-pi: Plan
-- use a pi3, attach the fe-pi to it.
-- network it

1) flash one of our own images.
2) add the fe-pi lines to /boot/config.txt
3) boot it and find on network
4) arecord -l - is it there?
5) make a asoundrc file for it
5) make a mics file for it.
6) use testrec to get viable output.

Use that guy's script to explore_alsa_settings...
or use alsamixer.  Use the microphone splitter.
if it works, use with a piface shim clock on a known-working A+ (there's a zero over there we can use).

have all 5 running simultaneously, and found this problem:

1) raspi3 red led stays on.  Why?

keep it running and push the ethernet cable into it: (it doesn't
reboot - it's worse with the dongle, but this pi has a eth slot so no
power drain).

now log in and look at /sys/class/led...
[ quick look at audio looks fine, amon log looks fine]
TODO: cron.log is still in /home/amon/amon/cron.log, it should be in
* * * * * /home/amon/amon/amon watchdog >> /mnt/sdcard/amondata/logs/cron.log 2>&1

LEDS: the red one is led1, and although it claims it is triggered by [none], the light is ON.
root@solo:/sys/devices/platform/leds/leds/led1# cat trigger
[none] kbd-scrolllock kbd-numlock kbd-capslock kbd-kanalock kbd-shiftlock kbd-altgrlock kbd-ctrllock kbd-altlock kbd-shiftllock kbd-shiftrlock kbd-ctrlllock kbd-ctrlrlock timer oneshot heartbeat backlight gpio cpu0 cpu1 cpu2 cpu3 default-on input panic mmc0 mmc1 rfkill0 rfkill1

But if we simply re-do the "echo none > trigger", it goes out.
double checking for a problem in solo-boot.sh...
This happens only on rpi3 where people don't care about power, so I don't care about the red led staying on.

parted -m "$ROOT_DEV" u s resizepart "$ROOT_PART_NUM" "$TARGET_END
parted -m /dev/mmcblk0 unit s resizepart 2 $NEWEND-in-blocks-of-512.
TARGET_END=$((ROOT_DEV_SIZE - 1))

-m = machine readable output

So we could simplify the shrink process, and shrink the image we ship by 200M (compressed down to I dunno).
Might be worth trying. TODO TODO TODO. but leaving for the moment, as I want to move on to fe-pi support instead.

now deep in testing.  Finding problems on raspi zeros.  Unreliable and
strange failures to boot.  Possibly to do with this:

booted pizero with network dongle AND HDMI connector to see console.
Noticed it's doing some junk with partitions that it shouldn't.
[NOTE: YOU HAVE TO TURN OFF LOWPOWER MODE, ELDSE HDMI GETS TURNED OFF]

However, I think there is a diff between cards.  Trying a different
physical SD card now.... Yes - it was the memory card (it kept
failing).  Tried to confirm it had badblocks with "badblocks -w -v
/dev/sdf" on desktop, but got bored after 20 mins. and turned it off.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

TODO: for imminent release 2017-08-24
----------------------------
- grep for TODO in all code (defs.sh in particular)

- minimize 
  - do this work in slimdown.txt, where there is previous expertise.
  - packages (see the debug log)
  - files (/opt/mpg  others? clac.tar.gz 
  - purge and debug.
  - go through big packages (use img-mount / img-chroot).
  - clear out all of /var/log/ (do it from pre-provision?)

- crontab.log has spillover from amix calls?

TODO - perhaps for next release:
- pizero flash negate.

TESTING:
--------

> Networked tests of soundcards with testrec:
1) CLAC with (line in, dmic, stereo, 192000, various gains).
2) SB2 with (16000/48000, stereo (not sup), various gains).
3) SB3 with (16000/48000, stereo (supported), 

> Finalised Testing rigs:
CLAC:  Various runs 
A+ with dodotronic (don't care about clock)
B+ with dodotronic (don't care aobut clock)
pi2/3 with dodotronic (don't care about clock)
pizero with dodotronic (don't care about clock)
