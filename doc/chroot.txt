output (copy.img) is flashable SSI.

qemu/chroot for mounting/provisioning images.
---------------------------------------------

Until now, the process of building a SSI has been:

flash an SD card on PC, move it to physical rpi, find networking kit
for that pi, boot it up, log in, run provision.sh, poweroff, move
SDcard back to PC, dd to PC, and shrinkImage.sh.

Now I just run chroot-img.sh (with image in pwd) and it provisions it.
Hallelujah. (still need to add shrinkImage.sh, but it's not really
worth it now that we are using the raspbian lite images).

This is an enormous time saver.

So how does it work.

chroot-img.sh mounts the / and /boot partitions of the raspbian.img,
copies in qemu-user-static, and chroots you into it.  (not before
coopying in "pre-provision.sh" from solo.git).  The chroot
automatically starts pre-provision.sh, which installs git (that is why
it is needed), and then git-clone's the solo.git repo, and then calls
the standard "provision.sh", which provisions the raspbian lite
installation with solo functionality (amon etc...).

it then exits the chroot, replaces a few niggles (ld.so.conf),
unmounts the two partitions.

Done.  copy.img is now flashable as a SSI.

I'm still amazed this can be done.
