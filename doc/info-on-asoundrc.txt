The changes proposed below worked.  Although I didn't split up the
alsa config file into one-per-mic. 


2017-08-19 locating alsa's config files
---------------------------------------

motivation: I don't want asoundrc to be in the solo.git repo, but rather the amon.git repo.
Moreover I don't want it in "amon"'s home dir as .asoundrc.  I want it in a sys
tem place.

read this:
----------

https://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Asoundrc
[ and probably this: http://www.volkerschatz.com/noise/alsa.html ]
[ and possibly this: http://alsa.opensrc.org/Asoundrc ]

/usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf   <---- main entry point (includes all others)
includes various configs from /usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf.d/*.conf]
includes /etc/asound.conf
~/.asoundrc

/usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf.d/*.conf

-> so try this - call it alsa-solo.conf
chmod a+r it, (so alsalib can actually read it).

....  Better - we should split up the asoundrc we have into a set of separate ones, one per microphone.  But perhaps do that later, first...

do a testrec test with
1) asoundrc in normal place in /home/amon/.asoundrc
2) move this file to tmp place
3) check the testrec fails.
4) move it to /usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf.d/alsa-solo.conf
5) check the testrec works again.
6) Done - so...
- cp asoundrc file from solo.git to amon.git repo, and commit it.
- find the thing that installs amon (provision.sh, I hope)
- find the thing (in solo.git?) that installs the asoundrc file.
- change it to install in /usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf.d/alsa-solo.conf
- git commit push github
- dailyBuild.sh
- boot and test it out.
