flashing the led
-----------------

initially implemented 29 Oct 2014

The red led is hard wired to the power supply - if there is power, red led is on.

On B models, there are 3 others, but they are all ethernet things, and
can only(?) be controlled through that driver.

Activity led on pi can be controlled through kernel module accessible
through /class/sys/led/led0.  Setting trigger to various settings
makes it flash according to different strategies.  Currently, at boot
time, (from normalboot) we have

modprobe ledtrig_heartbeat
echo heartbeat > /sys/class/leds/led0/trigger

This gives a permanent heartbeat, dependent on system load - shows kernel is runnning.

It doesn't differenciate between amon being on or off.

refs and info:
ACTivty LED is GPIO 16
