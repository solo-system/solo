Memory card speeds (write)
--------------------------

Just bought 6 new memory cards. All 64Gb. All SDXC. All microSD:

8.8 MB/s	11.50p	UHS-1 / class 10	Kingston.
17.0 MB/s	14.98p	UHS-1 / class 10	SanDisk Ultra
20.0 MB/s	22.44p	UHS-3 / class 10	SanDisk Extreme

So: the difference between kingston and SanDisk Ultra was worth paying
for, (twice speed for 4 pounds more).  But the Ultra -> Extreme wasn't
worth it.

These are write speeds (what solo does).  I didn't measure read speeds.

----
experiment setup:
lsusb -t (shows speed of connection on USB devices).

used: dd if=somehting.iso of=/dev/sd? bs=4M ; sync

bs=4M speeds things up. the bigger the better.  40M is no better, though.

bs=512 drops performance to 3.9MB/s
absent drops performance to 3.9MB/s (probably defaults to destn blk size)
