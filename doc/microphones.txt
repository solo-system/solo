Notes about Microphones.
------------------------

Just tested voltage output on pins of 3.5mm female jack connector on
the CLAC (Cirrus Logic Audio Card).  It's the pink one on the board,
also referred to as "line in".

It has a functionality known as "Mic Bias", which supplies a voltage
down these lines (in the wrong direction, if you like to see it that
way), to power the microphone.  The experiment is to understand this
voltage, and when it is applied.

Setup: raspi A+ with CLAC.  3-pin jack to XLR cable plugged into
line-in socket (pink).  Fluke 117 multimeter probes being shoved into
the XLR female (or is it male?) connector.  Reading DC volts.

Pins are labeled on the XLR conector (as I look at the end of it):

                
pin-2 ->     o     o     <- pin-1
                o
 
                ^
                |
 	      pin-3

Measuring pin-1 is the earth, pin 2 and three the "balanced" signal
pins (left and right).

When not recording, the voltages are all zero. Absolutely zero on my
meter. Both between pin-1 and pin-2, and between pin-1 and pin-3.
Also just tried between pin-2 and pin-3, and got zero again. Good.

Now turn on recording WITH MIC-BIAS: 
pin-1 to pin-2: 2.753V
pin-2 to pin-3	2.751V

Now disable micbias:
pin-1 to pin-2:  V
pin-2 to pin-3  V

COMMANDS USED TO DEBUG THE WIERD HANG:

amixer -Dhw:sndrpiwsp cset name='Line Input Switch' on

arecord -d 1 -Dhw:sndrpiwsp -r 44100 -c 2 -f S32_LE /tmp/out.wav
arecord -d 1 -Dhw:sndrpiwsp -r 44100 -c 2 -f S32_LE /tmp/out.wav
# as many as you like ...
arecord -d 1 -Dhw:sndrpiwsp -r 44100 -c 2 -f S32_LE /tmp/out.wav

amixer -Dhw:sndrpiwsp cset name='Line Input Switch' off

the alsa reset does NOT always clear it
