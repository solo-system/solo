Notes on witty pi usage and DC-DC converter efficiency based on 6
hours per day ON.

All amp measurements are @ 12V

should work in maH/day as an average consumption.  Then know a 50Ah
batery will last N days.


Assume RPI uses 40mA when running. (44 on screen, flash to 65 => ave 50, minus 10 of converter).

nowitty + converterBasic = (40+10)mA * 24hrs = 1200 mAh / day
nowitty + converterExtra = (40+ 1)mA * 24hrs =  984 mAh / day

WITH PERFECT TIMER (on 6hrs/day off 18 hrs / day.):

witty + converterBasic = (40+10)mA * 6hrs + (10)mA * 18hrs = 480 mAh / day
witty + converterPlus  = (40+ 1)mA * 6hrs + (1)mA * 18hrs  = 264 mAh / day

NOW HAVE WITTY NUMBERS:
