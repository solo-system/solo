NFS - how to add NFS export of /mnt/sdcard
------------------------------------------

[ Just tested this on 2016-04-30 and it works.]

1) Don't use /etc/exports, rather make file /etc/exports.d/solo.export
(see man exports).  This is easier to create in provision.sh

2) make it a "ro" export.

3) There is a 90 second "Grace Time" at nfs restart (or boot) - see
dmesg after sysctl restart.  This is annoying - either switch to nfs3
somehow (which probably doesn't have it), or reduce the grace time
somehow (fiddle with /proc/fs/nfs/nfsv4gracetime)


To add to solo: Add this to provision.sh:

sudo apt-get install nfs-kernel-server
then fill /etc/exports with:
/mnt/sdcard/       *(rw,sync,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check)

then...
systemctl start rpcbind nfs-common nfs-kernel-server
[at boot - ensure systemd does it]

means the solo serves file on p3 over nfs.  So do this (on your PC):

mkdir solomnt
mount 192.168.1.XX:/mnt/sdcard solomnt

and browse away.

... actually it's better than that - you can create and change files.
This is very odd - probably because p3 is a fat partition with no
concept of ownership.  Better to have (ro) than (rw) in above probably.

--- If we add this to general solo stuff, it's unlikely to help anyone
except me, but the usefulness is high.  Need provision to do apt-get
install, and to fill /etc/exports.  The remainder should just
work. (prehaps check systemd starts all the services).

It's tempting to serve stuff up through nginx (or apache). with php we
have control too, which is tempting, particularly for new pi3.

But should all this stuff clutter up the SSI - making it longer to
flash.  (space is negligible).  So it SHOULD all be installed (how big
is nginx+PHP).  should it all run all the time?  no (pi A+ has tiny
ram and will fall over.
