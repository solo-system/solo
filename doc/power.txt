Experiment: Comparison of 2 12v -> 5v converters:
-------------------------------------------------

Setup: test 3 converters using LED bulbs 

1) CIGGY: a cigarette -> USB converter (maplin>) with silver half hoop
   on front (and green LED)

2) Fulree 12-5vdc with 2 USB outputs.  codename FULREE (from ebay)

3) CPT ebay 

Both connected directly to Halfords car battery (@12.9V - measured by
volt meter across battery terminals. Current out of battery measured
by fluke meter.  Load is a pair of USB LEDs attached to the "spider"
(a USB hub).

Results:
     	 Unloaded      Spider+2LED    (diff - ie used on load)
CIGGY: 	  25mA         105mA	      80mA
FULREE:   10mA	        89mA	      79mA
CPT:	  10mA		86mA	      76mA

RESULT: So looks like they both do roughly same job on conversion, but the
CIGGY wastes lots of current on itself (lighting it's led?). Actually,
the CPT turns out to be just that bit better.

ADDITION: later bought CARCHET model (looks identical to FULREE and
CPT).  When attached to battery it wastes only 2mA - which initially
is good.  But then load it, and it must "Turn On" because when you
then unload it again, it wastes 20mA (unloaded).  So bad for this
application.  TODO: find out what's gonig on inside ?.  I've noticed
some converters (eg LM2596 chip) have an "enable" pin, that turns
on/off the circuitry of the converter.

Should spend some proper money on RS/Farnell and get a _proper_ DCDC
converter that is _good_ at doing ~= 1W. (all these are 15W).

Experiment: poweroff quiescent power consumption:
-------------------------------------------------

Setup: fluke measures amps at car battery terminal.  DC-DC is the
fulree from above.

Results:	fulree	fulree	  fulree      CPT      CPT	  CPT (barreled to CLAC)
		B+-clac  A+-clac  A+-noclac  A+-clac  A+-noclac  A+-clac
unconnected	 10mA	  10mA	    10mA      9.3mA     9.3mA	  9.3mA
running 	112mA	 44-67mA    44mA     44.0mA    44.0mA	 44.0mA
poweroff	 37mA	  23mA	    25mA     21.5mA    25.2	 21.2mA

This is odd - the clac seems to REDUCE the poweroff consumption. Try
feeding 5v into the CLAC directly using the barrel connector.

Conclusion: 
raspi consumes 11-15mA on top of the 10mA of the DC-DC. 

--------

Discussion.  When idle (poweroff), the total draw is 10mA + 11mA (120mW + 132mW = 252mW)
	          running              total draw is 10mA + 34mA (120mW + 408mW = 528mW)


So we save only 1/2 of the power by being poweredoff.  So, given
we want recording for 4 hours a day, all that standby time
is a TERRIBLE waste.  So shut down fully - and Disconnect.  Therefore
we need a timer/switch

at 528mw, we use 12Wh per day. which is 1Ah per day.
