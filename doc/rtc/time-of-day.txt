Sometimes we will be networked, and if so, the RTC is not the only
source of time.  So:

1) if time.nist.gov is available, we MUST use it (would we _ever_ prefer our RTC over time.nist.gov?)

2) if we find nist we always set system time from it, and then the RTC (if it exists).

3) if nist (networking) not present -: set from rtc (if present)

4) if !nist and !rtc - it's 1970.

if we get 1970 behaviour, we should be careful that reboots don't
cause overlap/overwrite.  Perhaps pushd previous directories.


This is NOT an amon thing, so I am reluctant to put it in the watchdog
(which handles time changes under it's feet without giving it any
thought).  Nice.

So what does the system do about (eg) a RTC that we can't read (keep trying, or give up at boot time).

How about noticing when we have tried the RTC (many times?) and failed
to get a time from it (or it gave us a time of zero - is that
different).

WAIT.

The possibilities are (at boot):
if (NETWORKING) -> get network time - set systime()  set RTC (if exists).
else (No networking)
     if (RTC)
       set time claimed by RTC
     else



At Boot time we must setup RTC agressively, and waste time on it - loop 5 times adding RTC and checking RTC.

If we have an RTC that keeps reporting time=0. ignore it, and set it if we can.
