Howto build a Solo Software Image
---------------------------------

We start with a stock raspbian image and modify it to produce an image
which will run a Solo.  

### get recent raspbian release (raspbian.img) and flash to a card:
sudo dd bs=4M if=~/solo/images/2015-05-05-raspbian-wheezy.img of=/dev/sdX ; sync ; sync

### Boot it on raspi hardware, and log in:
ssh raspberrypi -l pi

### then type (on the raspberry pi):
sudo su
apt-get update
apt-get install -y git # needed for raspbian "lite" editions.
cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/solosystem/solo.git
cd solo
chmod +x /opt/solo/provision.sh
./provision.sh   # this does a lot so have a cup of tea.
sudo poweroff

### Move card back to pc, and copy image to HDD.
sudo dd bs=512 count=6400000 if=/dev/sdX of=~/raspi/images/solo-xxx-`fdate`-bloated.img ; sync

### and you now have a file which can be flashed to an SD card for use
### in a Solo or you can feed it to shrinkImage.sh to make it more
### compact.
