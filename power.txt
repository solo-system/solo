Comparison of 2 12v -> 5v converters:

1) CIGGY: a cigarette -> USB converter (maplin>) with silver half hoop
   on front (and green LED)

2) Fulree 12-5vdc with 2 USB outputs.  codename FULREE (from ebay)

Both connected directly to Halfords car battery (@12.9V - measured by
volt meter across battery terminals. Current out of battery measured
by fluke meter.

LOAD: pair of USB LEDs attached to the "spider" (a USB hub).

     	 Unloaded      Spider+2LED    (diff - ie used on load)
CIGGY: 	  25mA         105mA	      80mA
FULREE:   10mA	        89mA	      79mA

So looks like they both do roughly same job on conversion, but the
CIGGY wastes lots of current on itself (lighting it's led?)
