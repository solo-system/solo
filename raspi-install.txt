Howto build a solo .img (SSI) from a raspbian img.
--------------------------------------------------

# get recent raspbian release (raspbian.img) and flash to a card:
sudo dd bs=4M if=~/solo/images/2015-05-05-raspbian-wheezy.img of=/dev/sdX ; sync ; sync

## Move to raspi:
ssh raspberrypi -l pi

# then type (on the raspberry pi):
sudo su
cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/solosystem/solo.git
cd solo
chmod +x /opt/solo/provision.sh
./provision.sh   # this does a lot
sudo poweroff

## Move card back to pc, and copy image to HDD.
sudo dd bs=512 count=6400000 if=/dev/sdX of=~/raspi/images/solo-xxx-`fdate`.img ; sync

### and you now have a file which can be flashed to an SD card for use in a Solo
### or you can feed it to shrinkImage.sh to make it more compact.
